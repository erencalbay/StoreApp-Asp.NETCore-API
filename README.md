## NLog
NLog is a powerful logging library used in the .NET platform. It provides a flexible and customizable framework for recording runtime events of applications through XML-based configuration files. NLog stands out with its ability to direct logs to various targets (file, database, console, event log, etc.). With support for targets and filters, it enables effective configuration of logging processes. It facilitates debugging and performance monitoring in large and complex applications.

## Global Error Exception

In the context of ASP.NET Core Web API (or any web application framework), global exception handling involves catching exceptions that occur during the processing of requests and returning appropriate error responses to the clients. Instead of allowing exceptions to propagate to the top level and exposing technical details to the end-users, global exception handling can convert those exceptions into more informative and standardized error messages in a format such as JSON or XML.

## AutoMapper

AutoMapper is a simple library that helps us to transform one object type into another. It is a convention-based object-to-object mapper that requires very little configuration. The object-to-object mapping works by transforming an input object of one type into an output object of a different type.
